Contains ANTLR generated classes: Lexer, Parser, and TreeParser

<p>
The Java source code in this package is generated by a translation process made 
possible by ANTLR. This translation process goes FROM a grammar TO Java code. 

Java source code for this package is generated by running the following command:

<pre>
> java -cp $CP org.antlr.Tool [path]/RuleLang.g
</pre>

Where $CP includes the antlr-3.2.jar file and [path] leads to RuleLang.g. As such, 
the Java source code in this package is not intended to be edited directly, but 
always through the grammar, by updating the RuleLang.g file, then by running the 
command above to translate the grammar into Java and replace .java source files 
with new ones that reflect changes in the .g file. 

Manual edits to the generated Java source code, any edits to the .java files in 
this package, may result in parser modifications that are near impossible to 
back-port into the grammar, and may cause the grammar to be out of sync with the 
code. <strong>Do not edit the Java source code in this package.</strong>

Please see the <a href="http://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR</a> web site for documentation.
